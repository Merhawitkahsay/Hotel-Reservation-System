(The "Lobby & Guest Rooms")
This is your React + Tailwind application. It's the "face" of the hotel that all guests see and interact with.

Root Level

package.json
What is it? The "shopping list" for your React app.

What goes in it? Dependencies like react, react-dom, axios (for API calls), react-router-dom (for pages), and tailwindcss.

Why is it needed? Manages all your front-end libraries.

tailwind.config.js
What is it? The settings file for Tailwind CSS.

What goes in it? It tells Tailwind where to find your files so it can scan them for class names. You also use this to customize your design, like adding your hotel's brand colors.

Why is it needed? To make Tailwind work and to customize its styles.

index.html
What is it? The only HTML page for your entire site.

What goes in it? A very simple HTML shell. The most important line is <div id="root"></div>.

Why is it needed? React is a Single Page Application (SPA). It loads this one file, then uses JavaScript to inject all your components (the "lobby," the "rooms") into that root div.

src/ (The "Art & Design" Department)
src/main.jsx
What is it? The "Front Door" or "Ignition Key."

What goes in it? It finds the <div id="root"> from index.html and tells React to render your main <App /> component inside it.

Why is it needed? This is the file that officially starts the React app.

src/App.jsx
What is it? The central "Lobby" or "Hub" of your app.

What goes in it? This is where you set up your react-router-dom routes. It defines all your pages (e.g., <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />). It's the main container for all other components.

Why is it needed? It acts as the main "air traffic controller" for your pages, telling React which page to show based on the URL.

src/components/
What is it? Your "LEGO Box."

What goes in it? Small, reusable UI pieces. Button.jsx, Navbar.jsx, Footer.jsx, RoomCard.jsx. These components are generally "dumb"—they just display data.

Why is it needed? Reusability! You don't want to re-write the code for a button every time. You just import your styled <Button /> component.

src/pages/
What are they? The "Assembled Rooms" or "Pages."

What goes in it? Page-level components like HomePage.jsx, LoginPage.jsx, MyBookingsPage.jsx. These components are "smart"—they use services to fetch data and then assemble smaller components (from your LEGO box) to build a full page.

Why are they needed? To separate your reusable parts (components) from your specific pages.

src/layouts/
What is it? The "Picture Frame."

What goes in it? A file like MainLayout.jsx. This component renders the Navbar at the top, the Footer at the bottom, and then renders the specific page content in the middle.

Why is it needed? To avoid repeating code. This way, you don't have to import your Navbar and Footer on every single page.

src/services/
What is it? The "Telephone" to the backend.

What goes in it? All your API (Axios/fetch) calls. authService.js would have login(email, password). roomService.js would have getAvailableRooms(checkIn, checkOut).

Why is it needed? It keeps all your API logic in one place. Your pages should be clean. Instead of a messy axios call, your LoginPage just calls the login() function from this service.

src/context/
What is it? The app's "Brain" or "Central Whiteboard."

What goes in it? React Context files. AuthContext.jsx is the most common. It holds global data, like "is the user logged in?" and "what is their token?"

Why is it needed? It lets you share important data (like the user's login status) across your entire app without having to pass it down as props through 10 different components.

src/assets/
What is it? The "Art Supply" closet.

What goes in it? Non-code files. Your hotel's logo.png, hotel-room.jpg, custom fonts, or global .css files (though Tailwind reduces the need for this).

Why is it needed? To keep your images and other static assets organized.
